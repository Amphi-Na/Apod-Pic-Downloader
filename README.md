Apod Pic Downloader is a python script through which you can download the Apod-Astronomy Picture Of the Day. 

- First thing you need to do is go to [Nasa API Website](https://api.nasa.gov) and get your api key.

- Just enter your first name, last name and email address. Then click signup.
- It will give you an API key.
- Now go to the folder and open your shell and type:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
OR
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Now open the main.py in you favourite editor and in place of 
```Python
{'api_key': #paste your api key from https://api.nasa.gov inside double quotes}
```
- replace it eith your api key. And then run the program. Simple.


### Note
This program uses Python 3.8. It may work on lower versions but I have not tested it.
